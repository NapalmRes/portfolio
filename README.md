# Portfolio

A collection of projects I have done over the years



## C++ Programming

A project for my university in which I used machine learning algorithms to make a minimum decision tree
## EERover

An LTSpice file for a circuit I designed and then subsequently built, and some of the code I wrote in Arduino Sketch for a 6-person rover project
## Discord Game Bot

I programmed A Discord bot that allows anyone on the server to send commands to the Discord bot to play various games and store users' high scores. The games the bot has are: 
1. A simple word game similar to Scrabble where you are given combinations of letters and try to get the highest score. The high score for each user is stored and can be retrieved via a command 
2. Hangman with hints that can be given by typing in * instead of a letter when prompted for a letter 
3. Rock paper scissors against the computer or another person on the server. The number of wins, draws and losses each player has is stored and can also be retrieved via a command
