# Portfolio

A collection of projects I have done over the years



## C++ Programming

A project for my university in which I used machine learning algorithms to make a minimum decision tree
## EERover

An LTSpice file for a circuit I designed then subsequently built, and some of the code I wrote in Arduino Sketch for a 6 person rover project
## Discord Game Bot

A Discord bot I programmed, which allows anyone on the server to send commands to the Discord bot in order to play various games and store users highscores. The games the bot has are: 
1. A simple word game similar to scrabble where you are given combinations of letters and try to get the highest score. The high score for each user is stored and can be retrived via a command 
2. Hangman with hints that can be given by typing in * instead of a letter when prompted for a letter 
3. Rock paper scissors against either the computer or another person on the server. The numbers of wins, draws and losses each player has is stored and can also be retrived via a command
4.
