# Portfolio

A curated collection of projects demonstrating my skills in programming, circuit design, and system development.



## C++ Programming

A university project where I implemented machine learning algorithms in C++ to create a minimum decision tree. This project highlights my ability to apply complex algorithms and optimize decision-making processes.
## EERover

A key contribution to a 6-person team project, where I designed and built a demodulation circuit using LTSpice. Additionally, I wrote Arduino Sketch code for the rover’s sensor systems, including infrared, radio, and ultrasonic components. This project showcases my proficiency in both hardware design and embedded programming.
## Discord Game Bot

Developed a versatile Discord bot capable of hosting multiple games and tracking user performance. The bot includes:

1. Word Game: Similar to Scrabble, where players are given letter combinations to maximize their score. The bot tracks and stores high scores, retrievable via commands.
2. Hangman: Classic hangman game with a twist—players can request hints by typing * instead of a letter.
3. Rock Paper Scissors: Playable against the bot or another server member, with wins, draws, and losses recorded and accessible through commands.
  
This project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, game logic development, and API integration with Discord.
